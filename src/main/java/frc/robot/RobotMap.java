    Here go all the ports used throughout the robot (besides those for cameras)!
    They should all be public (-> can see outside RobotMap), static (-> accessible with RobotMap.portName), and final (-> constant/read only), e.g. public static int leftMasterMotor = 40;
    We'll assume that we only have 1 robot here, the competition bot, so there will only be 1 set of ports.
    Make sure that this reflects the ports document at all times!!!!!!!!!
